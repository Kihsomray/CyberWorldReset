  #     TP/RTP World Setup     #
  #                            #
  ##############################

  # A TP/RTP world is one that is not intended to be reset. It is only
  # used to TP/RTP into. A setup like this allows the default world,
  # which cannot be reset, to still have random teleport functionality.
  #
  # For this type of world setup, you only want to include the enabled
  # option and teleport section as shown in the example below.
  #
  # NOTE: The default world CANNOT be reset. This rule is enforced by
  # Bukkit, and there is no way to bypass it! Trust me, I tried!
  #
  # The name of the setup is the name of the world (case-sensitive)!

      # as a place where the player is teleported to. For an RTP world,
      # it will act as the middle point for the radius.
      #
      # Examples:
      # --> 'DEFAULT' - Teleports to world spawn point.

      #            - X, Y, and Z coordinate.
